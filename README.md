Offline Rakshak
Overview
Offline Rakshak is a robust communication solution designed to facilitate critical interactions between individuals and emergency responders—such as doctors, police, and rescue teams—in scenarios where traditional communication networks fail. This project addresses the challenges faced during war zones, natural disasters, or internet shutdowns, where internet and mobile network connectivity are unavailable or unreliable.
Problem Statement
In crisis situations like conflicts, natural calamities, or government-imposed internet blackouts, the lack of communication infrastructure severely hampers coordination between affected individuals and emergency services. Most existing applications rely on internet or cellular networks, rendering them ineffective in offline environments.
Solution
Offline Rakshak provides a decentralized, offline communication platform that enables seamless exchange of critical information without dependency on internet or mobile networks. By leveraging alternative technologies (e.g., peer-to-peer networking, radio signals, or mesh networks), the project ensures reliable connectivity for:

Sending distress signals to nearby responders.
Sharing location and status updates.
Facilitating coordination among emergency teams.

Key Features

Offline Communication: Operates without internet or cellular networks.
Emergency Alerts: Allows users to send prioritized distress signals to responders.
Cross-Platform Support: Compatible with various devices to maximize accessibility.
Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle dynamic and high-pressure environments.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design for use under stressful conditions.

Use Cases

War Zones: Enables civilians to contact rescue teams or medical personnel.
Natural Disasters: Supports communication during earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes.
Internet Shutdowns: Ensures connectivity during government-imposed network restrictions.
Remote Areas: Aids communities with limited or no network infrastructure.

Technology Stack

To be detailed based on implementation (e.g., peer-to-peer protocols, hardware integration).
Open to contributions for exploring technologies like LoRa, Bluetooth mesh, or ad-hoc Wi-Fi.
